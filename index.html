		<h2>FAQ:</h2>
		<h3>What data do you even want?</h3>
		<p>Literally you just have to select which two jobs out of a list are the most similar.</p>
		<h3>Why should I give you all my data?</h3>
		<p>Because it's what all the cool kids are doing. Also, if you give me the most data you will get your choice of
		   some candy or like 45min to an hour of computer stuff from me. For legal reasons, I cannot explain how good of 
		   a prize that is, but it's good. I can say the stuff I've been caught for, which is unfortunately just the dumbest
		   stuff that I've done, like the script to crash computers that I wrote 'cause I was board and it got me a ISS when
		   the wrong person saw it. If you don't see how that's useful, consider that you could get a free pass to get out 
		   of class to get your computer fixed and then just... idk... be out of class? I won't give out a prize that is 
		   illegal, but there's plenty I can do within the confines of the law.</p>
		<h3>How can I give you all my data?</h3>
		<p>You can download the zip file from <a href="https://github.com/ConnorMeng/data/raw/refs/heads/main/runthis">here</a>, extract it, run the python script, and then send me the file 
		   it generates at data.endurable636@passinbox.com. It will look like DATA56829858205.txt or something like that.</p>
		<h3>What if I just answer the questions randomly to give you fake data and get free candy?</h3>
		<p>Try it and find out :)</p>
		<h3>Are you going to give me a virus?</h3>
		<p>Probably not, refer to previous question for more. In reality though no, I pinky swear I won't.</p>
		<h3>Why is this on github pages?</h3>
		<p>Because the schools tech staff are a bunch of ****** eating ***** ***** who blocked my main site. It's
		   also available on siteconnor.com/data but due to how big of giant ****** eating ***** ***** they are,
		   they categorize my site as unknown but allow github. I mean ffs, Github? There are programs here
		   that can render pornographic pictures of Shrek in geometry dash, but whatever.</p>
